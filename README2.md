***FUNCTIONS***
Allot of the functions were repettative. I could not figure out how to make them all function as one entity. but as soon as i figured out how to make them work i ran it. testing as i went to make sure every little bit worked though allot is just repetitive. i did what i could with the knowledge i have.

***MODALS?***
Because i couldn't figure out how to make them run as a single entity i made them all each their own individual entity and used "block" and "none" to pull and push them from the on page view.

***PAGE INFO***
I couldnt quite figure out how to reset my variables back to their original numbers time =(180) aka 3 minutes and my counterR(Right) and counterW(Wrong) back to "0" the name seems to rest just fine.

***Q/A***
I spent roughly 100hrs trying to research different ways to do this homework (I get it I'm not that good at Google yet).

The questions I came up with myself(obviously). From knowledge that I gained over the course of this class to the best of my knowledge.

Allot of coffee went into the creation of this project.

I CAN actually explain everything going on in the code and why it works. For... YOU people.   

I'm not sure what I was doing wrong but I couldnt get the log info to append to a board the way I wanted it to. (I dont think I was dong things in the right order). Try as I might I couldn't get that to function properly. (Keep in mind this class is my first any computer anything). So don't be a phallic related object. If you actually care to make me better help a guy out and correct me instead of being a canis lupus familiaris.
