***README***

To be honest with you. like before, i have writen and deleted 
atleast a good.... 14 times. i understand more than i did through this homework and through allot of extra stuff i've been doing on the side.

***I Was Hoping***

I was hoping to do a little better than this this time around... but i will likely be changing this and ALL of my other homeworks as i go when i start actually knowing what i'm doing a little better. witch hopefully is soon.

***At Least***

Atleast this README probably looks incermountably better than my previous ones and i hope i atleast get credit for that LOL.

***Internals***
inside this folder is what i had hoped to be a timer. witch i could never figure out the correct order of operations for (witch i realized is difficult and very important).

I tried to use button functions to string rightAnswers and wrongAnswers into what would have been a scoreboard and them dataloged witch I couldnt figure out. all and all. I know what needed to be done. but I couldnt figure out how.

my html and css are solid.

JavaScript. not so much. slowly, like a snail going in circles on a turtles back i go back and fourth slowly peicing tiny bits together that i hope someday form proper functional functions so that i can gain something from the knowledge before me and have a bigger impact on tomorrows world. 

***As of Now***
as of right now i feel about as important as the flea that bites my cat.
